# Simpformers
A simple transformers implementation with NumPy.

This repo provides an basic implementation of a Transformer model using NumPy. The goal is to help you understand the inner workings of the Transformer architecture by building it from scratch.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**: This code is written in Python 3, so you'll need to have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **NumPy**: NumPy is required for numerical computations. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
```
